*(didnt have any ideas for the name)* 
Pog Twitter is my project that I have been working on which allows you to tweet with a custom Source Label **(the thing that is under the tweet)** which is possible but many people had a problem with tweeting a picture/video using python or whatever they used. This changes **everything**. Kapp

# Installation
[Download latest release](https://github.com/Jelodev/Pog-Twitter/releases/latest/download/Pog-Twitter.exe)

Put the exe somewhere and run the application.

# Creating Twitter app

* Go to [Twitter Developers](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps)
* Then they will probably ask you to apply for a **Developer** account unless you already did before.
* Once approved, you can create an app using the link above and here is an example of how you should fill in all of the information:

App name is the source label by the way.

* After you filled in all the required information and created the app you should now see three buttons, one of them is "Keys and tokens", press it.

* You will see your **API Keys** and **Access Tokens** copy and paste them into **Pog Twitter** and press the blue button **Update**.

Everything should be now working, tweet something and check if it appears on your profile!
**If it doesn't work **PLEASE** create a new Issue!**
